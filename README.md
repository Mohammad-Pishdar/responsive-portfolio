Today's world is witnessing an ever-increasing number of people who use small screen devices to browse the internet and it has created a lot of demand for web page responsiveness. Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Responsive layouts automatically adjust and adapt to any device screen size, whether it is a desktop, a laptop, a tablet, or a mobile phone (<cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Wikipedia</a></cite>). The prevalence of smartphones and tablets caused a major shift in internet browsing habits of the people with so many of potential target audience of businesses with an online presence are mainly exposed to mobile versions of the websites.   
As of Q2 2018, smartphones held a 63% share of all retail website visits while 85% of adults think that a company’s website when viewed on a mobile device should be as good or better than its desktop website and 57% of internet users say they won’t recommend a business with a poorly designed website on mobile (<cite><a href="https://www.sweor.com/firstimpressions">SWEOR</a></cite>).   
Bootstrap is an open-source CSS framework that provides which is lightweight and customisable, provides responsive structures and styles, is consistent across all major browsers and helps save a lot of time while giving the felxibility to web developers to create awesome responsive websites.
